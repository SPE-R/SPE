  Does the exposure (smoking level, obesity, etc) have a \alert<2>{causal effect} on the outcome (blood pressure, cancer diagnosis, mortality, etc)?

  Is the exposure \alert<3>{associated} with the outcome?

	\frametitle{How to define causal effects (properly)?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One can think of some basic guidelines (sometimes called as ``criteria'') that must be satisfied for causal effect to be identifiable. 
		\item Such principles may include temporality (cause preceding the outcome), consistency (reproducibility), monotonicity (dose-response), plausibility (e.g. biologically), etc. (Bradford Hill's guidelines)
		\item \alert{However, although such general guidelines are useful, they are often not sufficient to establish causality}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What is a causal effect?}
	\begin{block}{Possible questions \ldots}
		 	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In case I stop eating white bread, would my weight drop?  \quad \sini{or \ldots} 
		\item In case white bread were eliminated from the world, would the average weight of all people decrease?  \quad \sini{or \ldots} 
		\item If, in a ``parallel worlds'' we could a) eliminate white bread (thus no-one gets any bread) and b) have everyone eating, say 200 grams of white bread per day, would the average weight (after a while) differ in the two worlds. 
	\end{enumerate}
			\end{block}
		Actually, question 3 is what we are going to explore next, but first let's define the counterfactual quantities of interest.
\end{frame}

\section{Causal effects using counterfactuals}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Causal effects and counterfactuals}


To define valid causal contrasts, we \puna{counterfactual} (what-if) thinking is useful.
\begin{block}{Counterfactual outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $Y$ is the outcome of interest and  $X$ is a binary exposure (for simplicity), thus $X=1$ for exposed and $X=0$ for unexposed individuals.
\item Define $Y^1=Y(X=1)$ and $Y^0=Y(X=0)$  as individual's \sini{potential (counterfactual)} outcomes if this individual's exposure level $X$ were \sini{set} to 1 or 0, respectively. 
\item For a particular individual, either $Y^1$ or $Y^0$ can be observed at any moment. 
\item Consistency: 
$$\text{if} \quad X_i=x, \quad \text{then} \quad Y_i^x=Y_i^X=Y_i$$
($X$ is a random variable for the actual treatment.)
%\item However, the contrast (difference, ratio, \ldots) between $Y^1$ or $Y^0$  is what we are actually interested in.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
Example: $Y^1$ individual's blood pressure, if he/she were a smoker; $Y^0$ individual's blood pressure, if he/she were a nonsmoker;

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Individual and average causal effects (ACE)}
\begin{block}{The \puna{individual causal effect}}
	The treatment X has a causal effect on an individual’s outcome Y if 
	\[Y^1 \ne Y^0.\]
\end{block}
	In epidemiology we are mostly interested in the averages.
	\begin{block}{The (population) \puna{Average Causal Effect (ACE)}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An average causal effect of exposure $X$ on outcome
			$Y$ is present if
			\[E(Y^{1}) \ne  E(Y^{0}).\] 
			\item For binary $Y$, this would be:
			\[P(Y^{1}=1) \ne  P(Y^{0}=1)\] 
			\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Do we usually estimate causal effects?}
Causal effects are easily estimable, if:  $ \  \ Y^x \indep X$, \\[2mm]  
as in this case  $\E(Y|X=x) = E(Y^x |X=x) = E(Y^x) $. \\[2mm] 
This condition is, however, rarely satisfied. 

\nt{If $Y$ is weight and $X$ the quantity of bread consumed (slices/day),then:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \nt{ $\E(Y^x)$ would be the average weight in population, in case everyone eats exactly $x$ slices of bread a day;} 
		\item\nt{ 
		$\E(Y|X=x)$ would be the average weight in \sini{subset} who actually eat $x$ slices of bread a day;}
	\end{itemize}
	The population can be divided into subsets with $X=0$, $X=1$, $X=2$, etc. $\E(Y|X=x)$ would be the average in one of such subsets, but \sini{$\E(Y^x)$ would be the average for the entire population} for each possible value of  $x$.

			\item With a binary exposure $X$, compare average outcomes in exposed and unexposed populations:
			\[E(Y|X=1) - E(Y|X=0)\]
			\textcolor{blue}{Is cancer incidence different in smokers and nonsmokers?}

	\end{itemize}}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Potential outcomes (counterfactuals) in different settings}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \alert<1>{Randomized trials}: probably the easiest setting to imagine $Y^X$ for different $X$. \\[0.3cm]
		\item \alert<2>{``Actionable'' exposures}: smoking level, vegetable consumption, \ldots -- potential interventions may alter exposure levels in future.\\[0.3cm]
		\item \alert<3>{Non-actionable exposures}: e.g genotypes. It is difficult to ask \emph{``What if I had different genes?''}. Still useful concept to formalize genetic effects (heritability, attributable risk). \\[0.3cm]
		\item \alert<4>{Combinations}: With X-- a behavioral intervention level, Z--smoking level and Y--a disease outcome, one could formalize the effect of intervention on outcome by using $Y^{X, Z(X)}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Estimability of causal effects in an ideal randomized trial}
	Causal effect is estimable in a \puna{randomized trial (RCT)}, where the subjects are randomly assigned to two arms: $R=1$ and $R=0$. In an \sini{ideal} (but often not realistic) RCT: 
		$$\E(Y^0) = \E(Y^0|R=0) \equiv \E(Y|R=0),$$
	because when $R=0$ then also $X=0$ and we observe $Y=Y^0$ (consistency!). \\  
	Similarly: 
	$$\E(Y^1) = \E(Y^1|R=1) \equiv \E(Y|R=1)$$ 
	and thus we can estimate the causal effect of treatment in such study.
	\begin{block}{}	
		In epidemiology, however, exposures are not randomized and therefore the estimation of causal effects is complicated (and not always possible).
	\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Does adjustment for covariates help?}
	Adjustment for confounders is helpful, if:
	$$Y^x \not\indep X, \quad  \text{but } \quad Y^x \not\indep X | Z,$$ (\sini{conditional exchangeability}), implying 
	$$E(Y^x) \ne E(Y|X=x), \quad \text{but } \
	E(Y^x|Z) = E(Y|X=x, Z=z),$$
	for a set of covariates $Z$. \\
	(Within levels of $Z$, $X$ is randomly ``assigned''.)\\[5mm]
	Under conditional exchangeability, one can \sini{test} for the causal effect by simple regression adjustment. For \sini{estimation} of the average causal effect, a few ``tricks'' can be used (Esa's lecture on Thursday). 
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Classical/generalized regression estimates vs  causal effects?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item In the presence of confounding, regression analysis provides a biased estimate for the true causal effect
\item To reduce such bias, one needs to collect data on most important confounders and adjust for them
\item However, too much adjustment may actually introduce more biases   
\item Causal graphs (Directed Acyclic Graphs, DAGs) may be extremly helpful in identifying the optimal set of adjustment variables
\end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

\section{Causal graphs, confounding and adjustment}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DAGs: directed acyclic graphs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graphical representation of the causal association structure in the data, where variables are presented as nodes (points) and the associations are presented as edges (lines, arrows);
		%\item Thus an arrow pointing from variable $X$ to a variable $Y$ on such graph represents a causal effect of $X$ on $Y$.

$V_m$ is a \textcolor{blue}{descendant} of $V_j$ (and $V_j$ is an \textcolor{blue}{ancestor} of $V_m$) if

\item You need to select adjustment variables that block all \sini{open} paths.
\item \alert{Don't} adjust for colliders (as they would open the closed paths)!

\begin{itemize}

\item The validity of any causal effect estimates depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions.
\item Adjustment for other available variables may remove (some) confounding, but it may also create more confounding. \alert{Do not adjust for variables that may themselves be affected by the outcome.}   
\item Instrumental variables approaches can be helpful, but beware of assumptions!

	\frametitle{Statistical model vs causal model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rewrite the linear causal model as 
		\[Y^x_i =  Y^0_i +  x \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i, \ \; \mbox{ with } E(\varepsilon_i|x)=0\]
		\item Note that this would be equivalent with the classical linear model, if 
		$$E(Y^0_i + \varepsilon_i|X_i)= \beta_0,$$ 
		\alert{thus when the potential exposure-free outcome $Y^0$ is not associated with the exposure $X$}
		\item  For instance, this would mean that in the absence of smoking, the cancer risk for current smokers and current nonsmokers would be the same ($E(Y|X=0) = E(Y^0)$).
		\item In other words, the two models are equivalent in the absence of \alert{confounding}.
