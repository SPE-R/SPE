\section{How to define a causal effect?}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Statistical associations vs causal effects in epidemiology}
  \begin{block}{}
  Does the exposure (smoking level, obesity, etc) have a \alert<2>{causal effect} on the outcome (blood pressure, cancer diagnosis, mortality, etc)?
  \end{block}
is not the same question as   
 \begin{block}{}
  Is the exposure \alert<3>{associated} with the outcome?
  \end{block}
 Conventional statistical analysis will answer the second one, but not necessarily the first. 
%  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Example}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{kohv_egv_1} \\
\begin{block}{}
Does coffee-drinking prolong life? \\
(so drastically???)
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Example (cont.)}
	\includegraphics[width=6cm]{kohv_egv_2} \\
\begin{block}{}
	Does coffee-drinking prolong life? \\
Or: \textcolor{blue}{do coffee-drinkers live longer (for several reasons)?}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{How to define causal effects (properly)?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One can think of some basic guidelines (sometimes called as ``criteria'') that must be satisfied for causal effect to be identifiable. 
		\item Such principles may include temporality (cause preceding the outcome), consistency (reproducibility), monotonicity (dose-response), plausibility (e.g. biologically), etc. (Bradford Hill's guidelines)
		\item \alert{However, although such general guidelines are useful, they are often not sufficient to establish causality}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Causal effects and counterfactuals}
\begin{itemize}
\item To define causal effects more properly, \alert<1>{counterfactual} (what-if) thinking is useful.
\item Mathematically, the individual causal effect can be defined as the difference 
 \[Y^1 - Y^0,\]
where $Y^1=Y(X=1)$ and $Y^0=Y(X=0)$ are defined as individual's \alert<2>{potential (counterfactual)} outcomes if this individual's exposure level $X$ were \alert<2>{set} to 1 or 0, respectively. 
\item Example: $Y^1$ individual's blood pressure, if he/she were a smoker; $Y^0$ individual's blood pressure, if he/she were a nonsmoker;
\item For a particular individual, either $Y^1$ or $Y^0$ can be observed at any moment. 
%\item Sometimes people (e.g J. Pearl) use the \alert<3>{``do''} notation to distinguish counterfactual variables from the observed ones: $Y(do(X=1))$ and $Y(do(X=0))$.     
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The ``na\"ive'' association analysis}
	{\small  \begin{itemize}
			\item With a binary exposure $X$, compare average outcomes in exposed and unexposed populations:
			\[E(Y|X=1) - E(Y|X=0)\]
			\textcolor{blue}{Is cancer incidence different in smokers and nonsmokers?}
			\item But mostly:
			\[E(Y|X=1) \ne E(Y^1)\]
			\textcolor{blue}{Cancer risk in smokers is not the same as the potential cancer risk in the population if everyone were smoking}
			\item Similarly:
			\[E(Y|X=0) \ne E(Y^0)\]
			% \textit{Cancer risk in nonsmokers is not the same as the potential cancer risk in the population if there were no %smokers}
			\item In most cases there is always some \alert{unobserved confounding} present and therefore the
			na\"ive analysis does not provide causal effect estimates.  
	\end{itemize}}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Potential outcomes (counterfactuals) in different settings}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \alert<1>{Randomized trials}: probably the easiest setting to imagine $Y(X)$ for different $X$
		\item \alert<2>{``Actionable'' exposures}: smoking level, vegetable consumption, \ldots -- potential interventions may alter exposure levels in future.
		\item \alert<3>{Non-actionable exposures}: e.g genotypes. It is difficult to ask \emph{``What if I had different genes?''}. Still useful concept to formalize genetic effects (heritability, attributable risk).
		\item \alert<4>{Combinations}: With X-- a behavioral intervention level, Z--smoking level and Y--a disease outcome, one could formalize the effect of intervention on outcome by using $Y^{X, Z(X)}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{A causal model in terms of potential outcomes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item More generally $Y^x$ is defined as the potential outcome following the exposure level $X=x$
		\item A \alert{linear causal model} can be specified as 
		\[Y^x_i -  Y^0_i=  x \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i, \ \; \mbox{ with } E(\varepsilon_i|x)=0\]
		\item Note that the observed outcome $Y_i = Y_i^{x}$ for individuals with $X_i=x$.   
		\item The model could be generalized to include nonlinear terms or interactions with other covariates, or as a generalized linear model (logistic regression, survival model). 
		\item However, as we don't observe $Y^0$ and $Y^x$ (with $x>0$) for the same individuals at the same time, thus it is not straightforward to actually fit the model on data.  
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Statistical model vs causal model}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item More generally $Y^x$ is defined as the potential outcome following the exposure level $X=x$
		\item A \alert{linear causal model} can be specified as 
		\[Y^x_i -  Y^0_i=  x \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i, \ \; \mbox{ with } E(\varepsilon_i|x)=0\]
		\item Note that the observed outcome $Y_i = Y_i^{x}$ for individuals with $X_i=x$.   
		\item  	A \alert{classical linear regression} model: 
		\[Y_i = \beta_0 + X_i \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i, \ \; \mbox{ with } E(\varepsilon_i|X_i)=0\]
		or 
		\[E(Y_i|X_i) = \beta_0 + X_i \beta_1. \]
		\item 
		\alert{ When are the two equivalent?}
	   
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Statistical model vs causal model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rewrite the linear causal model as 
		\[Y^x_i =  Y^0_i +  x \beta_1 + \varepsilon_i, \ \; \mbox{ with } E(\varepsilon_i|x)=0\]
		\item Note that this would be equivalent with the classical linear model, if 
		 $$E(Y^0_i + \varepsilon_i|X_i)= \beta_0,$$ 
		 \alert{thus when the potential exposure-free outcome $Y^0$ is not associated with the exposure $X$}
		\item  For instance, this would mean that in the absence of smoking, the cancer risk for current smokers and current nonsmokers would be the same ($E(Y|X=0) = E(Y^0)$).
		\item In other words, the two models are equivalent in the absence of \alert{confounding}. 	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Classical/generalized regression estimates vs  causal effects?}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item In the presence of confounding, regression analysis provides a biased estimate for the true causal effect
\item To reduce such bias, one needs to collect data on most important confounders and adjust for them
\item However, too much adjustment may actually introduce more biases   
\item Causal graphs (Directed Acyclic Graphs, DAGs) may be extremly helpful in identifying the optimal set of adjustment variables
\end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DAGs: directed acyclic graphs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graphical representation of the causal association structure in the data, where variables are presented as nodes (points) and the associations are presented as edges (lines, arrows);
		\item Thus an arrow pointing from variable $X$ to a variable $Y$ on such graph represents a causal effect of $X$ on $Y$.

 Actually there might be a complicated system of
causal effects:

{\small  C-smoking; D-cancer \\

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What to do in complicated cases?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch a causal graph
\item Identify all paths between the exposure and outcome (ways to go from $X$ to $Y$ regardless of the direction of the arrows).
\item Identify the \sini{closed} paths that include colliders and \sini{open} paths that don't.  
\item You need to select adjustment variables that block all \sini{open} paths.
\item \alert{Don't} adjust for colliders (as they would open the closed paths)!
 \item If you are looking for the total effects, you don't need to block the \sini{directed} paths (that follow the directions of the arrows). 
\item \alert{Often, there are unobserved confounders!}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The total effect of $X$ on $Y$ is estimable without any adjustment.
	\item For direct effect you need to adjust for $Z$, but that would open the closed path -- to block that, you also need to adjust for $W$. 
	\item If $W$ is an unobserved confounder, direct effect of $X$ on $Y$ cannot be estimated.

\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no unique definition of ``the causal effect'' 
\item The validity of any causal effect estimates depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions.
\item Adjustment for other available variables may remove (some) confounding, but it may also create more confounding. \alert{Do not adjust for variables that may themselves be affected by the outcome.}   
\item Instrumental variables approaches can be helpful, but beware of assumptions!
