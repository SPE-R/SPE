% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

  \frametitle{Programming with Data}

  \begin{quote}
  ``We wanted users to be able to begin in an interactive environment,
  where they did not consciously think of themselves as programming. Then
  as their needs became clearer and their sophistication increased, they
  should be able to slide gradually into programming.''
  -- John Chambers, Stages in the Evolution of S
  \end{quote}

  ~\\
  
  This philosophy was later articulated explicitly in {\em Programming
    With Data} (Chambers, 1998) as a kind of mission statement for S

  ~\\

  \item After the break up of AT\&T in 1984 it became possible for them
    to sell S.
  \item S-PLUS was a commercially available form of S licensed to
    Statistical Sciences (later Mathsoft, later Insightful) with added
    features:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item GUI,survival analysis, non-linear mixed effects, Trellis

  \item These packages are known as the ``tidyverse''

  \item All packages in the tidyverse have a common design philosophy
    and work together. Common features are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Non-standard evaluation rules for function calls.
    \item Use of the pipe operator \verb+|>+ (or \verb+%>%+) to pass
      data transparently from one function call to another.

    and empowering people of genders currently under-represented in
    the R community. R-Ladies' primary focus, therefore, is on
    supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their
    programming potential, by building a collaborative global network
    of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate
    individual and collective progress worldwide.
