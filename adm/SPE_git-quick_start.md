This document is a quick uide to clone/pull the latest version of [SPE repository](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE).
For ease of use, I will use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) software in this document.

# Prerequest

  - having [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) installed on your machine. ([How to Install GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install]))
  - having a [github](https://github.com/) account and being a member of [SPE-R](https://github.com/orgs/SPE-R) 
  organization ([list of SPE-R members](https://github.com/orgs/SPE-R/people))
 
 
# Linking GitKraken to your github account

1. Open `GitKraken` software
2. If this is the firs time you open the software, you will be asked to give some git ids. Click on 
**Sign in with GitHub** and enter your [github](https://github.com/) credential.

Once you have done it once you should be automatically connected connected to your git account each time
you will open `GitKraken`. You should easily check it in the upper right corner of `GitKraken` window.
