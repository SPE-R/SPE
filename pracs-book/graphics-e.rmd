# Graphics meccano
The plot below is from a randomized study of the effect of
Tamoxifen treatment on bone mineral metabolism, in a group of
patients who were treated for breast cancer.

The data are available in the file `alkfos.csv` (using comma as
separator, so `read.csv` will read it).
```{r }
# change filename as needed
alkfos <- read.csv("./data/alkfos.csv") 
```

The purpose of this exercise is to show you how to build a similar
graph using base graphics in R. This will take you through a number of
fundamental techniques. The exercise will also walk you through
creating the graph using `ggplot2`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("./data/alkfos-house.r")
```

To get started, run the code in the housekeeping script
`alkfos-house.r` . You probably should not study the code in
too much detail at this point.  The script create the following
objects in your workspace.

  -  `times`, a vector of length 7 giving the observation times
  -  `means`, a $2 \times 7$ matrix giving the mean percentage
    change at each time point. Each group has its own row.
  -  `sems`, a $2 \times 7$ matrix giving standard errors of
    the means, used to create the error bars.
  -  `available`, a $2 \times 7$ matrixing giving the number
    of participants still available

Use the `objects()` to see the objects created function to see
them.

## Base graphics

Now we start building the plot. It is important that you use some form
of script to hold the R code since you will frequently have to modify
and rerun previously entered code.

  -  First, plot the means for group 1 (i.e. `means[1,]`) against
    `times`, using `type="b"` (look up what this does)
  -  Then *add* a similar curve for group 2 to the plot using
    `points` or `lines`.  Notice that the new points are below the $y$
    scale of the plot, so you need to revise the initial plot by setting
    a suitable `ylim` value.
  -  Add the error bars using `segments`. (You can calculate the
    endpoints using `upper <- means + sems` etc.). You may have to
    adjust the `ylim` again.
  -  Add the horizontal line at $y=0$ using `abline`
  -  Use `xlab` and `ylab` in the initial `plot` call to    give better axis labels.
  -  We need a nonstandard x axis. Use `xaxt="n"` to avoid plotting
    it at first, then add a custom axis with `axis`
  -  The counts below the x axis can be added using `mtext` on
    lines 5 and 6 below the bottom of the plot, but you need to make
    room for the extra lines. Use `par(mar=.1 + c(8,4,4,2))`
    *before* plotting anything to achieve this.


You now have quite a good reconstruction of the original plot. There
are some additional steps you can take to reproduce the published plot
exactly. These are advanced exercises so feel free to come back to
them later.


  -  It is not too important here (it was for some other variables
    in the study), but the S-PLUS plot has the points for the second
    group offset horizontally by a small amount (.25) to prevent
    overlap. Redo the plot with this modification.
  -  Further things to fiddle with: Get rid of the bounding box.
    Add Control/Tamoxifen labels to the lines of counts. Perhaps use
    different plotting symbols. Rotate the y axis values. Modify the
    line widths or line styles.
  -  Finally, try plotting to the `pdf()` device and view
    the results using a PDF viewer (*e.g.* Adobe Acrobat
      Reader). You may need to change the `pointsize` option
      and/or the plot dimensions for optimal appearance. You might
      also try saving the plot as a metafile and include it in a Word
      document.


## Using ggplot2

The housekeeping script `alkfos-house.r` also creates a data
frame `ggdata` containing the variables in long format. The
code for generating the data frame is shown below, but you do not need
to repeat it if you have run the script.
```{r }
ggdata <- data.frame(
  times = rep(times, 2),
  means = c(means[1, ], means[2, ]),
  sds = c(sds[1, ], sds[2, ]),
  available = c(available[1, ], available[2, ]),
  treat = rep(c("placebo", "tamoxifen"), each = 7)
)
ggdata <- transform(ggdata, sems = sds / sqrt(available))
```
To create a first approximation to the plot in `ggplot2` we
use the `qplot` function (short for *quick plot*). First you
must install the `ggplot2` package from CRAN and then load it:
```{r }
library(ggplot2)
qplot(
  x = times, 
  y = means, 
  group = treat, 
  geom = c("point", "line"), 
  data = ggdata
)
```
The first arguments to `qplot` are called *aesthetics* in the
grammar of graphics.  Here we want to plot `y=means` by
`x=times` grouped by `group=treat`. The aesthetics
are used by the *geometries*, which are specified with the
`geom` argument.  Here we want to plot both points and
lines. The `data` argument tells `qplot` to get the
aesthetics from the data frame `ggdata`.

To add the error bars, we add a new geometry *linerange* which uses
the aesthetics `ymin` and `ymax`
```{r }
p <- qplot(
  x = times, y = means, group = treat,
  ymin = means - sems, ymax = means + sems,
  yintercept = 0, geom = c("point", "line", "linerange"),
  data = ggdata
)
print(p)
```
In this case we are saving the output of `qplot` to an R
object `p`. This means the plot will not appear automatically
when we call `qplot`. Instead, we must explicitly print it.

Note how the y axes are automatically adjusted to include the error
bars. This is because they are included in the call to `qplot`
and not added later (as was the case with base graphics).

It remains to give informative axis labels and put the right tick
marks on the x-axis.  This is done by adding scales to the plot
```{r }
p <- p +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Months after randomization",
    breaks = ggdata$times
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "% change in alkaline phosphatase")
print(p)
```
We can also change the look and feel of the plot by adding a theme
(in this case the black and white theme).
```{r }
p + theme_bw()
```

As an alternative to `qplot`, we can use the `ggplot`
function to define the data and the common aesthetics, then add the
geometries with separate function calls. All the grobs (*graphical objects*) 
created by these function calls are combined with the
`+` operator:
```{r }
p <- ggplot(
  data = ggdata,
  aes(
    x = times, 
    y = means, 
    ymin = means - sems, 
    ymax = means + sems,
    group = treat
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_linerange() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "darkgrey") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = ggdata$times) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-35, 25, 5))
print(p)
```
This call adds another geometry *hline* which uses the aesthetic
`yintercept` to add a horizontal line at 0 on the y-axis. Note
that this alternate syntax allows each geometry to have its own
aesthetics: here we draw the horizontal line in darkgrey instead of
the default black.

## Grid graphics

As a final, advanced topic, this subsection shows how viewports from
the `grid` package may be used to display the plot and the
table in the same graph. First we create a text table:
```{r }
tab <- 
  ggplot(
    data = ggdata, 
    aes(x = times, y = treat, label = available)
  ) +
  geom_text(size = 3) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL)
tab
```
Then we create a layout that will contain the graph above the
table. Most of the space is taken by the graph. The
`grid.show.layout` allows you to preview the layout.
```{r }
library(grid)
Layout <- grid.layout(nrow = 2, ncol = 1, heights = unit(
  c(2, 0.25),
  c("null", "null")
))
grid.show.layout(Layout)
```
The units are relative (*null*) units. You can specify exact sizes
in centimetres, inches, or lines if you prefer.

We then print the graph and the table in the appropriate viewports
```{r }
grid.newpage() # Clear the page
pushViewport(viewport(layout = Layout))
print(p, vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = 1, layout.pos.col = 1))
print(tab, vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = 2, layout.pos.col = 1))
```
Notice that the left margins do not match.  One way to get the margins to match is to use the `plot_grid`
function from the`cowplot` package.
```{r }
library(cowplot)
plot_grid(
  p, 
  tab, 
  align = "v", 
  ncol = 1, 
  nrow = 2, 
  rel_heights = c(5, 1)
)
```
The `cowplot` package has a theme that is useful for publications. It is a black and white theme with no grid:
```{r }
theme_set(theme_cowplot())
plot_grid(
  p, 
  tab, 
  align = "v", 
  ncol = 1, 
  nrow = 2, 
  rel_heights = c(5, 1)
)
```
The `theme_set` function changes the default
`ggplot2` theme so that all subsequent displays will use the given theme.
