# Software required

## R version

The course material have been compiled and tested with
`r R.version$version.string`.
We advise to install this version of `R`. For installation instructions please refer to [CRAN wbsite](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Code source editing software

Any code editing software can be used during the course.
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an adapted solution. 

## R packages

```{r pkgs list, include=FALSE}
## install checkpoint package if not available
required.pkg <- sort(unique(unlist(renv::dependencies()[, 'Package'])))
command.str <- paste0("install.packages(c('", paste0(required.pkg, collapse = "', '"), "'))")
```

During the practical session, the following list of `R`the packages will be required:

`r paste0('- ', paste(required.pkg, collapse = "\n- "))`

which can be installed with the following command:

`r command.str`
